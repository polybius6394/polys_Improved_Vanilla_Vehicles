# polys_Improved_Vanilla_Vehicles
A small mod that adds some props to a handful of vanilla vehicles to make them feel more lived in. (Arma Reforger)

Everything in this mod functions the same as vanilla, with one or two upgrades that don't affect the game's balance whatsoever.

Currently adds:
- Reconfigured supply crates, added props, and a functioning radio for the M1025 (8 variants).
- Reconfigured supply crates, added props, and a functioning radio for the M1025 M2HB (8 variants).
- Reconfigured supply crates, added props, and a functioning radio for the BTR-70 (1 SOV variant, 1 FIA variant).

Planned features:
- More BTR-70 configurations.
- M998 configurations.
- M151 configurations.
- UAZ-469 configurations.
- M923 configurations.
- Ural-4320 configurations.
- UH-1H configurations (maybe).
- MI-8T configurations (maybe).
- UAZ-452A configurations (maybe).
- S1203 configurations (maybe).
- S105 configurations (maybe).

The new vehicles will replace the old ones by default, so this should be compatible with any gamemode out of the box.
